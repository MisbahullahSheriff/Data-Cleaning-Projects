# Car Details v3 dataset: A Data Cleaning Project

<br>

## Table of Contents:


<br>

## Project Overview:
- The main aim of this project is to clean the `Car Details v3` dataset and transform it to a form suitable for further exploratory data analysis for better interpretation or predictive modelling
- This project doesn't involve handling missing values or outliers, those steps are reserved to be done in the exploratory analysis step
- Rather, this project aims at identifying and correcting any invalid values and preparing the dataset for further exploratory analysis
- This project also aims to demonstrate my skills in Data Cleaning using Python and tools like Pandas and Numpy

<br>

## Files:
- `Car Details v3.csv`: contains the entire dataset used in the project
- `data_dictionary.txt`: provides a short description of the features present in the dataset
- `notebook.ipynb`: contains all the code written to implement the project
- `notebook.pdf`: the pdf version of `notebook.ipynb`

<br>

## Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Google Colab

<br>

## Data Cleaning Steps:
- Analyzed the meta-data about the dataset
- Identified and deleted the duplicate records
- Performed column-wise inspection; identified and treated any inaccuracies and inconsistencies within the data
- Implemented a function that takes in the raw dataset and returns the cleaned version
- All the data cleaning steps are implemented in `chain` manner, for better readability and proof of skill
